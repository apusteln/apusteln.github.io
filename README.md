A simple scroller Java Script game using Phaser 3

The player controls the green alien with arrows on the keyboard and has three extra lives. The player has to reach the finish at the right end of the map. Spikes and enemies take one life when touched. Enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads. If the player falls down the pit, he loses the game instantly.

Additionally controls: 'P' to pause and 'R' to restart the game after losing or winning.

In the pause menu you can press 'O' to generate a random level and play it.

You can save the map you're playing on in pause menu. There is "sample_level.json" on the repo, from which the game loads a level under 'L' in the pause menu, unfortunately the loading action does not yet workon the github site and has been disabled. The functionality has been enabled on 'local_webserver' branch, where you can run the game on your own webserver and check it out.
