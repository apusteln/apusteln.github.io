A simple scroller Java Script game using Phaser 3

The player controls the green alien with arrows on the keyboard and has three extra lives. The player has to reach the finish at the right end of the map. Spikes and enemies take one life when touched. Enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads. If the player falls down the pit, he loses the game instantly.

Additionally controls: 'P' to pause and 'R' to restart the game after losing or winning.

You can save the map you're playing on in pause menu, and you can load a json for a map on the site and run it from the pause menu. There is "sample_level.json" in repository to check it out.
